# What is a "CODEOWNER"?
#
# A CODEOWNER lends their expertise to a specific package hosted by an OpenTelemetry repository.
#
# A CODEOWNER MUST:
# - introduce themselves on the CNCF OTel Python channel: https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01PD4HUVBL
# - have enough knowledge of the corresponding instrumented library
# - respond to issues
# - fix failing unit tests or any other blockers to the CI/CD workflow
# - update usage of `opentelemetry-python-core` APIs upon the introduction of breaking changes
# - be a member of the OpenTelemetry community so that the `component-owners.yml` action to automatically assign CODEOWNERS to PRs works correctly.
